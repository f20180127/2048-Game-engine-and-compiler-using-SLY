The lexer and parser of the game are customized to allow 16 user operations 
(4 functions - ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY and 4 directions - UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). 

Apart from that cell tiles can be given any value and also named as well with distinct names. 
A value of a tile can also be accessed. 
All the commands are to be typed and the compiler handles the cases when the user types 
arbitrary input/syntax errors by displaying the proper messages on stdout and also stderr.
